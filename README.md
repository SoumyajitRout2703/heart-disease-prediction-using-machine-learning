Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in a patient using machine learning algorithms. By leveraging a combination of data preprocessing techniques and advanced classification models, this project aims to provide an effective solution to predict heart disease risk based on various medical attributes. This predictive model can be helpful for early detection and proactive health management.

Features

Data Preprocessing (cleaning, normalization, etc.)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding patterns in data

Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms

Model Evaluation and Comparison

Hyperparameter Tuning for improving model accuracy

User-friendly interface for making predictions (optional)


Dataset

The project uses the UCI Heart Disease dataset which contains information on various attributes like age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, and more.

Machine Learning Algorithms Used

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)


Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd heart-disease-prediction


3. Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage

1. Load and preprocess the dataset.


2. Train the model on the dataset.


3. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


4. Use the best-performing model to make predictions on new data.



Results

The performance of each model is evaluated, and results are compared based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Based on testing, the model with the highest accuracy will be selected for the final prediction task.

Future Work

Implementing deep learning models for improved accuracy

Adding additional features to improve model performance

Developing a web-based interface for easy access to the prediction model
